title: 'Welcome to my humble feedback abode'
layout: 'layouts/home.html'
metaDesc: 'My personal site for receiving feedback.'
goals:
  - goal: I want to be a team member that others can come to for help with semantic and accessible html, css, and js.
    selfEval: I am currently taking courses in CSS and have kept accessibility in mind while developing our latest features. I’ve  learned few things about designing before and  still I’m working on it to improvise myself and to achieve the desired goal.
  - goal: I want to improve my communication with and understanding of the design team, including learning different design terms and processes for better collaboration.
    selfEval: When I hear about a design term I am not familiar with I ask its meaning to expand my knowledge boundary. I always try to learn new things from various sources such as books or articles  from the Internet.
  - goal: I want to continue to learn about our project so I can contribute more meaningfully to technical discussions.
    selfEval: When new wiki items are presented to us I read through them carefully and I treat each new task as an opportunity to explore our code base further.

Hey! Thanks for taking the time to stop by and being here!

Below you'll find three goals that I am currently working on. I would absolutely love if you could give me your honest thoughts on how I am doing with regard to these goals, including any criticism, praise, and / or advice you feel comfortable giving.

On that note, I want you to feel as safe and comfortable as possible here! I am actively seeking out your feedback with my trust and respect towards you. In filling out this little form and clicking the submit button, you can be assured that I will:

- Not take offense upon receipt of negative feedback.
- Be appreciative of your time spent and feedback given.
- Seriously and thoughtfully consider your feedback.
- Develop a plan on how I can meaningfully act on it.
- Praise your act of giving feedback
- Give feedback to you (if you want / if I haven't already).

Also, below the explanation of each goal you will find a short self-evaluation that details how I'm currently working towards the goal. Feel free to ignore or use it if it helps in your own feedback formulation.

Can't wait to read your thoughts!
