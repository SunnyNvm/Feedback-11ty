**What is JAMStack ?**

Jamstack, previously stylized as JAMStack, is a web development architecture pattern and solution stack. The initialism "JAM" stands for JavaScript, API and Markup and was coined by Mathias Biilmann in 2015

**What are the benefits of using JAMstack approach?**

The JAMstack approach has several benefits, including:

1. Improved Performance: Since JAMstack sites are pre-built and served from a CDN (content delivery network), they can load quickly and deliver a better user experience.

2. Better Security: JAMstack sites are less vulnerable to attacks because they have no application layer or server-side code. Plus, many JAMstack services offer built-in security features, such as SSL certificates and DDoS protection.

3. Scalability: With JAMstack, scaling is easier and more cost-effective because static assets can be cached on a CDN. This means that the server only needs to handle API requests, which are often simpler and more efficient than handling dynamic page requests.

4. Simplified Development: JAMstack makes it easier to separate concerns, so developers can focus on building reusable components and optimizing their code. Plus, with a static site generator, developers can easily preview changes and build without having to worry about setting up a server.

5. Better SEO: JAMstack sites are inherently more SEO-friendly because they deliver fast page loads, structured data, and other features that search engines prefer.

6. Lower Infrastructure Costs: Since JAMstack sites don't require a server, they can be hosted on a CDN or static hosting service, which is often much cheaper than traditional hosting.

Overall, JAMstack can provide a faster, more secure, and more scalable web experience while also simplifying development and reducing infrastructure costs.

**What are static site generators or SSG??**

Static site generators (SSGs) are software tools that allow developers to create websites using pre-built templates and content stored in flat files, such as Markdown or HTML files. Unlike traditional content management systems (CMS), which generate web pages dynamically on each request, SSGs generate web pages ahead of time, before they are requested by the user.

The process of generating a static site involves several steps. First, developers create templates using HTML, CSS, and other web technologies. Then, they add content to the templates, often using Markdown or another lightweight markup language. Finally, they use the SSG to build the static site by compiling the templates and content into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that can be served to the user.

The main advantage of using an SSG is that it can deliver faster page loads and better performance than traditional CMSs because there is no need to query a database or process server-side code on each request. This makes SSGs especially well-suited for sites with a lot of content that changes infrequently, such as blogs or documentation sites.

Another benefit of using SSGs is that they can be deployed more easily and with less infrastructure than traditional CMSs. Since the resulting site consists only of static files, it can be served from a CDN (content delivery network) or hosted on a static hosting service, which is often cheaper and more scalable than traditional hosting.

**How can APIs be used to add functionality to a static site?**

- APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are a set of rules, protocols, and tools that allow different software applications to communicate and exchange data with each other. In the context of JAMstack, APIs are often used to provide dynamic functionality to static sites.

**There are many different types of APIs, but some of the most commonly used in JAMstack development include:**

- Content APIs: These APIs allow you to retrieve content from a third-party content management system (CMS) or database. For example, you could use a content API to retrieve the latest blog posts from a WordPress site and display them on a JAMstack site.

- Third-party APIs: These APIs allow you to integrate third-party services into your JAMstack site, such as payment gateways, social media platforms, or weather services. For example, you could use the Stripe API to process payments on an e-commerce site or use the Twitter API to display tweets on a blog.

- Custom APIs: These are APIs that you create yourself to provide specific functionality to your JAMstack site. For example, you could create an API to retrieve data from a database or perform some other custom task.

**How is markup used in JAMstack?**

Markup refers to the syntax used to create the structure and content of web pages. In JAMstack, markup is used to create the templates and content for static sites.
These templates can be written using HTML, CSS, and other web technologies and can include placeholders for dynamic content.

In addition to creating templates, markup is also used to create the content of static sites. JAMstack sites often use Markdown, a lightweight markup language, to create content for pages and blog posts. Markdown allows writers to easily create formatted text, such as headings, lists, and links, using plain text syntax.

Once the content is written in Markdown, the SSG can use a Markdown parser to convert it to HTML, which can then be included in the site's templates.

Overall, markup plays an important role in JAMstack by providing a way to create the structure and content of static sites. By using markup and static site generation, JAMstack sites can be fast, secure, and easy to maintain.

**What is 11ty/eleventy?**

11ty is a static site generator (SSG) that allows developers to build fast, secure, and easy-to-maintain websites using modern web technologies. 11ty is known for its _flexibility, simplicity, and ease of use_, making it a popular choice for building JAMstack sites.

Like other SSGs, 11ty takes content stored in flat files, such as Markdown or HTML, and generates a static website. However, unlike many other SSGs, 11ty is not opinionated about how content is organized or how templates are written. This means that developers can use any templating language, such as Nunjucks, Handlebars, or EJS, and organize their content in any way that makes sense for their project.

11ty also includes a number of features that make it well-suited for JAMstack development, including:

1. Built-in support for Markdown and other flat-file formats
2. Support for JavaScript-based templating languages
3. Automatic reloading during development for rapid iteration
4. Integration with popular front-end frameworks and libraries, such as React and Vue.js
5. A simple and intuitive configuration system
